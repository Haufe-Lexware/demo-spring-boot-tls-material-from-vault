Spring Boot Vault PKI Key- & Trustore Integration Demo
======================================================

This project is a demo of the use of the use of [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) 
to set up the TLS client and / or server configuration of Spring Boot 
applications. It extends on
[sample code published by Mark Paluch](https://github.com/mp911de/spring-cloud-vault-config-samples/tree/master/spring-cloud-vault/pki).

The demo was prepared for a [presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/HaufeDev/externalized-spring-boot-app-configuration)
at a meeting of the Java user group Freiburg in October 2017.
